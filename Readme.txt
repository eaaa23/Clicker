Just a tool while playing minecraft, and I'm afraid of the virus inside some `autoclicker` on the internet.

How to use?
0. Install python 3.8+ environment and package `keyboard`, `pymouse`, `pywin32`(if windows)
1. Run clicks.pyw
2. Select key in the combobox
3. Select CPS, Priority(see after) and other options
4. Click the `Start button`.

Options:
CPS: Clicks per second. Higher value means it'll click more quickly.
Priority: 3-5 means normal. 1-2 can resistant the program and reduce CPU burden.
